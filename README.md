# PayloadCMSTextArray

I did not find a field that supports an array of strings in the documentation of Payload CMS so I made it myself.

To use this field import `TextArray` and pass it to a field of type `json`. It will then show a list of text input fields with an add button.

## Info

The component uses some custom classes and some classes from the dependency itself.
